# Data-Mining-Approach-for-Predicting-Student-Performance

This study focuses on the application of data mining technique to predict student graduation based on their academic performance. The study used three different algorithms, namely Deep Learning, Linear Regression, and Neural Network. The study's purpose is to improve the accuracy of the development of more accurate models for predicting outcomes or scores and to have a better understanding of data using a data mining approach. The dataset for this study was collected from the grades of computer science students for 3 semesters in 2018. The results of this study indicate that Deep Learning achieved the highest overall accuracy, which is 94.38%, outperforming both Neural Network with an accuracy of 93.48% and Linear Regression with an accuracy of 91.25%. The study provides valuable insights into the application of data mining techniques for predicting student graduation, aiding decision-makers in making informed decisions based on accurate predictions and derived insights.
